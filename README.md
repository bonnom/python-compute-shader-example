# python-compute-shader-example
This contains a simple compute shader example that uses pygame and pyopengl. The pygame is just used as a creation for the opengl context. I made this just for myself but since AI currently struggles with creating useable code for compute shaders I decided to put on github.

To use the example first install the libraries: 
pip install pygame pyopengl
and ofcourse if you haven't installed numpy
pip install numpy
